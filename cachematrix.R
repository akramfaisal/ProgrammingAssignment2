## The task is to create a matrix inverse caching function. Inverse
## of a matrix is usually costly to compute. Therefore, is the
## matrix does not change, and if inverse is needed more than once,
## it might be a good idea to cache the inverse.
## NOTE: Caching sample code for mean of a vector was given,
##       therefore, will have similarity to it.
## NOTE 2: For this assignment, we are told to assume that the matrix
##         supplied is always invertible.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
